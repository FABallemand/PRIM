\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Working on a six-month research project at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris has been an enriching experience, marked by numerous technical discoveries. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported and guided me throughout the project and in the writing of this report.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors, Attilio Fiandrotti, Alaa Mazouz, and Sumanta Chaudhuri, Researchers at Télécom Paris, for their warm welcome, the valuable time spent together, and the knowledge they shared with me.

I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Alaa Mazouz, who directly supervised my work and collaborated with me throughout the project. His ongoing support and detailed explanations were crucial in helping me understand the tasks entrusted to me and in acquiring new skills that will undoubtedly benefit my future endeavors.
