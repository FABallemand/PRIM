Data compression and especially image compression is a crucial tool in information technology. Whether it is to save storage space or to improve networks efficiency, the goal is to represent the same information with the minimum amount of bits. Lossless compression is limited, leaving place to lossy compression. This compression method introduces a tradeoff between storage space and data quality/integrity.

Using existing deep learning and computer vision tools, \acrfull{lic} aims to provide a new way to perform image compression providing better results than previous deterministic codecs. \acrshort{lic} requires a lot of processing power making it unsusable on resource constrained platforms.

The final goal of this project is to explore technique allowing to use \acrshort{lic} on these low power devices possibly in realtime. After reproducing state of the art results, the goal is to explore frugal machine learning techniques such as pruning, quantisation and knowledge distillation.
